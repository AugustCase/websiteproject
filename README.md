This is a website created for a friend and bandmate to show off his creativity, along with past and present projects that he is working on. This is being created with the hopes that anybody looking to book him for a show or event, will have full access to everything that he has done and make educated decisions on whether he will be the right guy for the job.

3 ideas for future improvements

I believe that I could make the layout of the media page and home page more clean and crisp when changing from small to large screens. I could add more personality by editing colors and fonts. I could edit the images within the carousel to be the same sizes.
